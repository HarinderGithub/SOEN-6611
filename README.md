The course will cover both hypothetical and reasonable parts of programming estimation. Regarding the hypothetical viewpoint, 
you will be acquainted with many-sided quality programming measurements (McCabe, Halstead), 
question situated programming measurements (C&K, MOOD, and QMOOD), module union measurements (cut based union),
and in addition to systems and techniques for the hypothetical and exact approval of programming measurements.
